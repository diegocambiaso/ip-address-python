*SHow IP address with python

**Flask

This code creates a Flask application and defines a route for the root URL. When a user visits the root URL, the index() function is called, which retrieves the IP address of the client using the request.remote_addr attribute and stores it in the ip_address variable. It then returns a message that displays the IP address to the user.
Note that the request.remote_addr attribute may not always contain the correct IP address of the client, especially if the client is behind a proxy server or a load balancer. In such cases, you may need to use other attributes of the request object or additional libraries to get the correct IP address

**Django

This code defines a view function named index that retrieves the IP address of the client using the request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR') attribute and stores it in the ip_address variable. It then renders an HTML template named index.html that displays the IP address to the user.
Note that the request.META.get('REMOTE_ADDR') attribute may not always contain the correct IP address of the client, especially if the client is behind a proxy server or a load balancer. In such cases, you may need to use other attributes of the request.META object or additional libraries to get the correct IP address.
